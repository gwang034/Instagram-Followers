# 🎀 Instagram Followers 🎀
 Who doesn't follow you back? Don't be a fan xoxo
 
 This script is a fast (and safe!) way to check who doesn't follow you back on IG without potentially putting your account at risk to a bitcoin hacker 😍

**Download your Connection Data using the following steps:**
1. Go to your Instagram profile and click the three lines in the upper right hand corner (mobile) or bottom left hand corner (desktop). Select "Settings and Privacy" from the menu.
2. Select "Accounts Center" at the top.
3. Under Account settings, select "Your information and permissions" and tap "Download your information."
4. Request a download. For the purposes of this script, you only need to choose "Select types of information" > "Followers and following"
5. Once you are done selecting the information you would like, you will see the "Select the options" page. Provide an email for your data to be delivered to. **Make sure the data is delivered in JSON format**. Change the Date range to All time to see all of your followers and following (but beware this may make your download take longer if you have other types of data selected as well).
6. Once the data arrives, use **unfollow.ipynb** to see who doesn't follow you back!
